I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

            "Fictional portrayals of historical figures. Talk about Einstein a lot, but never mention Einstein's Nobel prize research. NEVER mention big name nuclear physics trailblazers.Poor acting. Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title.\n",

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why. I'm glad I watched it, and I'm glad to know more about the subject, but I wouldn't call it one of the best of the year. - Jeff Marshall,.\n",

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success.

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why. I'm glad I watched it, and I'm glad to know more about the subject, but I wouldn't call it one of the best of the year. - Jeff Marshall,.\n",

Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

When I woke up I continued to watch; little did I know, I Kid You Not, I'd been watching the black and white screen saver for nearly an hour before realizing it wasn't Oppenheimer.

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white. Better Call Saul did similar time jumps in color vs B&W sequences, and did it WAY better.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white. Better Call Saul did similar time jumps in color vs B&W sequences, and did it WAY better.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title.\n",

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

            "I know I am in the \"unwashed\" minority, and I do not care. This is a combination of a bad editing, terrible sound design and a director given a blank check to do whatever he wants. How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white. Better Call Saul did similar time jumps in color vs B&W sequences, and did it WAY better. I get the feeling the Oscar buzz is more of an apology tour to Nolan for not giving him anything on his better achievements with the Dark Knight trilogy. A total shame. Not best picture quality.\n",

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Two and a half hours in, we are still in character development and jumping between 3 different timelines. A confusing, boring slog. Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title.\n",

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white. Better Call Saul did similar time jumps in color vs B&W sequences, and did it WAY better. I get the feeling the Oscar buzz is more of an apology tour to Nolan for not giving him anything on his better achievements with the Dark Knight trilogy. A total shame. Not best picture quality.\n",

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title.\n",

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white. Better Call Saul did similar time jumps in color vs B&W sequences, and did it WAY better.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title.\n",

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

            "I know I am in the \"unwashed\" minority, and I do not care. This is a combination of a bad editing, terrible sound design and a director given a blank check to do whatever he wants. How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white. Better Call Saul did similar time jumps in color vs B&W sequences, and did it WAY better. I get the feeling the Oscar buzz is more of an apology tour to Nolan for not giving him anything on his better achievements with the Dark Knight trilogy. A total shame. Not best picture quality.\n",

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title.\n",

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why.

What's the point of such a talented cast, excellent cinematography, make up etc., for a long, tiresome, and poorly told story?The impression left is that this story should have been told in an 40-episode series, each episode lasting an hour, over 5 seasons. Instead, everything was condensed into a frenetic pace within 3 hours. Names and events were rushed, dozens of characters thrown in the audience's face, without adequate character development, cuts and transitions were too quick and too frequent, there was an overload of information, everything happened too fast.Nolan has incredible talent and knows how to make cinema at a very high level, he has proven that before.

How is it that at the most important moments of dialogue we are given percussion of ridiculously loud soundtrack music that drowns everyone out? I wanted to appreciate the performances, but it was impossible due to all the distracting acoustics. And don't get me started on the jumps to black and white. Better Call Saul did similar time jumps in color vs B&W sequences, and did it WAY better.

I know no more about Oppenheimer now than I did having watched this movie.Thirdly, the film is chaotic and all over the place. Back and forth and quick edits and time blurring. I was aggravated with the flow. I kept having questions, I would have stopped and googled the film to figure things out. But...Forth. It's way too long. This would have been a great HBO miniseries.

The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

            "This is more of a court room drama than an exciting movie about the man behind the Los Alamos laboratory. Two and a half hours in, we are still in character development and jumping between 3 different timelines. A confusing, boring slog. Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective. Clearly, I am in the minority and it will probably win all kinds of awards, but I don't think it deserves it.\n",

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras.

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why. I'm glad I watched it, and I'm glad to know more about the subject, but I wouldn't call it one of the best of the year. - Jeff Marshall,.\n",

            "This was great 👍 really great! Awesome plot. Loved the actors! They were great. Like to see it again because it was that good. The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

            "This is more of a court room drama than an exciting movie about the man behind the Los Alamos laboratory. Two and a half hours in, we are still in character development and jumping between 3 different timelines. A confusing, boring slog. Nolan has mastered the manipulation of timelines in his previous brilliant films, but here it just fails miserably until the pieces and timelines FINALLY coalesce in the last 10 minutes. Einstein is in the movie for 5 minutes and without giving any spoilers, he steals the show in the end.Oppenheimer could have been a 75 minute movie instead if 180 and it would have been so much more effective. Clearly, I am in the minority and it will probably win all kinds of awards, but I don't think it deserves it.\n",

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.\n",

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE!

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why. I'm glad I watched it, and I'm glad to know more about the subject, but I wouldn't call it one of the best of the year. - Jeff Marshall,.\n",

Every person that I know I asked him if they've seen Oppenheimer and I tell them that I highly recommend it it's a history lesson it's a paradox and I didn't even know who Oppenheimer was until this movie!

            "This was great 👍 really great! Awesome plot. Loved the actors! They were great. Like to see it again because it was that good. The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.\n",

            "No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the \"hearings\" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.\n",

            "The BluRay cover states \"one of the best movies of the century.\"That is a very bold claim.Top ten? No.Top 50? NoI would personally argue maybe top 100, but even that might be a stretch.This film had a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it when it first came out, so I had relatively high expectations. Having read many books on the Manhattan Project, I was expecting a lot more detail and historical facts. In many respects the storyline felt dumbed down, perhaps in an attempt to attract a wider audience. I felt short changed by the end, and although I thought it was a good movie overall, I'd much rather read a book like Annie Jacobson's \" The Pentagon's Brain\" if I want to explore this topic.This movie does some things right. It uses IMAX cameras in unorthodox ways that have never been done before, and it really makes the black and white scenes pop. It also embodies the class that old successful movies used to have, like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. That being said, this movie is 3 hours long, and it's not because there's so much story to tell. In fact, I was disappointed with the amount of storytelling given the subject. The filmmaker rather obsessed on many slow frame rate segments and scenes, and there's an abundance of time spent just doing still frames of Cillian Murphy's face up close. This adds not seconds, but minutes to scenes that could have been better utilized to tell important parts of the story. This is a very grand and big story, and this movie strangely minimizes the grandness of what was going on at the time. The Manhattan Project had 130'000 people working on it at the peak of the operation. This movie makes it seem tiny in comparison, and even the Alamos Texas scenes don't accurately represent the true scale of the operation.I hate to say this, but the enormous success of this film seems like more of a marketing success. Hollywood and media have gotten very good at convincing people that something is much better than it really is, and I feel like this is one of those cases.\n",

            "This is a very long, too long, excellent film about Robert J. Oppenheimer and since he is known as the father of the atomic bomb, we know exactly what this is about. It has been made by a master craftsman, Christopher Nolan, and it is impeccable in nearly all aspects other than the need for a little trimming. That's not saying any of it's really boring, but there's just a little more information here than the average moviegoer is going to want to sit through. At least one would have thought so?! We of course also deal with his private life which is less well known. Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer and this is certainly his greatest performance among an enormous cast of many, many well known actors and none come even remotely close to giving a weak performance. Robert Downey Jr., getting back to acting after years of pretty much the same likable performance in comic book movies, is the clear major costar here, but many others are exceptionally good in much smaller roles. This is mostly a cast of men, but the two principal women portrayed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are quite memorable. As a matter of fact they have two of the more memorable moments in the film. Pugh in a startling and unexpected sex scene in an unusual environment and Blunt in her final scene as an older woman with not a word of dialog is something you will remember. The film is a major undertaking, and while it is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, it is a must to see, but considering the amount of money this film made, most have, which I must say is a surprise now that I have seen it. It is far, far from any kind of popcorn movie. I suspect the Barbenheimer phenomenon helped this more than the other half of that moniker.\n",

            "The Oppenheimer movie, titled \"Oppenheimer,\" is a biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by a visionary filmmaker and backed by a stellar cast, the movie provides a gripping narrative that explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific contributions but also his moral dilemmas and the broader impact of his work on humanity.The film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, capturing his academic brilliance, multicultural influences, and the intellectual ferment of the early 20th century. Through meticulous storytelling and compelling performances, the audience is immersed in the academic circles and scientific breakthroughs that shaped Oppenheimer's early career. The script carefully balances scientific details with personal anecdotes, making the complex subject matter accessible to a wide audience.As the narrative unfolds, the movie chronicles Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project. The filmmakers skillfully recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime urgency, capturing the collaborative efforts of scientists and engineers racing against time to develop the atomic bomb. The depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, is a cinematic tour de force, conveying the awe and horror that Oppenheimer experienced.One of the movie's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's internal struggles. The script delves into the ethical dilemmas he faced as he grappled with the destructive power of the atomic bomb. The use of flashbacks and introspective moments provides insight into Oppenheimer's complex psyche, allowing the audience to empathize with the weight of his decisions. The famous line, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" is delivered with emotional resonance, encapsulating the moral gravity of Oppenheimer's role.The film also explores the aftermath of World War II, detailing Oppenheimer's advocacy for international control of atomic energy and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The political tensions and McCarthy-era paranoia add a layer of historical context, highlighting the broader societal implications of scientific advancements. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance becomes a dramatic turning point, adding a layer of suspense and tragedy to the narrative.In terms of cinematic elements, the Oppenheimer movie excels in its production design, cinematography, and score. The recreation of 1940s settings, from laboratories to war rooms, is meticulously done, immersing the audience in the historical context. The cinematography captures both the intimate moments of Oppenheimer's personal struggles and the grandiosity of scientific endeavors, creating a visually engaging experience. The musical score complements the emotional nuances of the narrative, enhancing the film's impact.The performances of the cast, particularly the actor portraying Oppenheimer, contribute significantly to the movie's success. The lead actor skillfully conveys the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, navigating the intellectual brilliance, moral conflict, and human vulnerability.\n",

            "This film, at the moment, should be considered Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. That's right. Christopher Nolan, master of epic action movies, has made his best work in what should be considered a hybrid of historical biopic and political thriller. This movie has more in common with something like JFK or All The President's Men than it does with Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy. If you realize that ahead of time, or can come to grips with it while viewing, you'll be handsomely rewarded.With any movie, there are a few things even a huge admirer can disagree with. I'll say what most people said, it's way too long for lacking the usual action of a Nolan movie. I noticed at least 20-30 minutes worth of material that could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the tension. I watched this at home and decided to split it in half and watch it on 2 separate nights. So maybe that's why it didn't feel like a massive undertaking for me. I think if I would have had to sit through it in the theater, I might be less pleased with it.The cast was hit or miss for me. The main cast were all fantastic, with all their awards and nominations well deserved. I'm a massive fan of RDJ's non-Marvel work, and I think this is his best performance. I just didn't need a big name for almost EVERY role. I could have done without Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and even Gary Oldman. I'd even argue Florence Pugh's entire storyline could have been cut.So why my high rating? Those 2 things are my only real bones to pick in what I think is still a completely engrossing thriller. I have to make special mention of the score for making normal, dialogue-focused scenes feel extremely intense. I'm a big fan of history-based movies. So admittedly, the subject matter was already in my wheelhouse. Casual Nolan fans might have been mad if they expected big action sequences. But if you haven't seen it yet, and understand it for what it actually IS, you will be very pleasantly surprised.\n",

            "A way to heighten public emotion by highlighting the worldwide heroes of a bygone era is still right as an entertainment that allows people to look away for a moment from the terrible reality through self-projection, and to release them from their daily lives. That way is important from a business perspective.During the WWII, the United States was on the verge of becoming a world leader in both name and substance. Like watching a sports game where you knew the outcome would be that your team would certainly win, the atmosphere of that era alone is enough to send audience into a whirlpool of enthusiasm and excitement. However, perhaps they ran out of great men to tell their stories, they finally decided to set up \"the father of an atomic bomb\".I know well that Christopher Nolan and his works are internationally acclaimed. But in this global age, the abolition of nuclear weapons is uniformly advocated, and the devastation in Ukraine and Gaza is daily reported. Still, could he be forgiven if he only depicts a crazy man's life poetically and skillfully?What this film does is simply to glorify the use of nuclear weapons.The film clearly shows the crystallization of the justification of atomic bombings, which must have been carried out as a national educational strategy in 80 years. The maximum political abuse of science can not be portrayed completely without the depiction of the people vaporized within seconds, the horrific sight of citizens, and its physical aftereffects that lasted for the half of the century. This is irrelevant that the naïve and timid Oppenheimer did not visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki during his visit to Japan.In 2023, G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, where heads of each government including President Biden visited the Peace Memorial Museum for the first time in 80 years. This historical moment made them retrospect that mankind killed people comparable to those in Ukraine and Gaza for only four days. If CNN doesn't broadcast the fight scenes there, viewers would condemn it for biased reporting. If Nolan is truly a wise man, he will realize at the end of his life, as Oppenheimer did, that he made a terrible mistake in his great career.\n",

Three or four time-lines are constantly mixed with no explanation or clue to where and when the depicted events take place. At the end of the movie I could not connect 80% of the names blurted out with a character in the film. If this movie gets an Academy Award it is totally an inside job.

The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras.

            "Did I just not 'get' this? I don't like million-dollar action movies or the things they pass for comedies these days, so I was excited when Oppenheimer made its way to streaming. I love Nolan as much as the next guy; his films feel purposeful rather than so much of the pointless cinema that exists today... but this movie was so drab. I love historically-based dramas, true stories, etc. But I'm at an honest loss for words. Maybe it's because it's the weekend and I wasn't as into it as a mindless watch, but I found myself dozing off throughout most of it. It's as if Nolan filmed hours of random scenes and just spliced them together in a hurry to make an excessively long, boring film. I suppose shooting it this way was to give the viewer insight into the way he felt Oppenheimer's brain worked, and the film is meant to reflect that? I honestly don't know. I'm no pyromaniac, but even the bomb detonation sequence was entirely anticlimactic. I guess the whole awful thing just went over my head. 1/10.\n",

Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: \"The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title.\n",

            "Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the \"Red Scare\" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.\n",

            "I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why. I'm glad I watched it, and I'm glad to know more about the subject, but I wouldn't call it one of the best of the year. - Jeff Marshall,.\n",
